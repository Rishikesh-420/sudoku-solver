Step 1: Create a function whose work is to check whether the grid is safe or not when a number is assigned to the current index. For the boxes, column, and row, create a HashMap for storing the frequency of the numbers.

If the HashMap shows the frequency of any number greater than 1, then return false, else return true. Instead of HashMap, one can use loops also.

Step 2: Write a recursive function that accepts the grid as the input.

Step 3: Look for the unassigned location in the grid. If the unassigned location is present, then assign a number from 1 to 9, check if the number that is assigned to the current index makes the grid safe or not

If the grid is safe, then recursively invoke the method for all the safe cases from 1 to 9. if any of the recursive calls return true, then terminate the loop by returning true. If there is no recursive call that returns true, then return false.

Step 4: If the total number of unassigned locations in the grid is zero, then return true.
